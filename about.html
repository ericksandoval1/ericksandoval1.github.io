        <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
        <p>I manipulate found videos and images together with my own artwork to make bright and nostalgic pieces.
            Through exploring the concept of nostalgia, I draw inspiration from the media of my early childhood to
            create
            art that connects the viewer to a positive thought or emotion.
        <p>
            I was born and raised in Santa Ana, CA. I am currently attending San Jose State University majoring in
            Digital
            Media Art.
